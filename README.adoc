== Camel components

We are using some custom-made camel components.

=== Camel filewatcher

Supports 'file watching'.


=== Camel SCP

An alternative to `camel-jsch`. Jsch is old and not very well-supported.

This module uses command line 'scp', which is very robust and very well tested. Much more so than jsch, or sshj.

It is more or less a drop in replacement for `camel-jsch` itself.

A few details are different

- `connectTimeout`: also accepts ISO_8601 durations like `PT30s` (which can be simplified to `T30s` or `30s`)
- `privateKeyFile`: may also pick up the key from the environment when prefixed with 'env:'
